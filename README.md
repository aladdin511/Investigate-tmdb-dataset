# Investigate-tmdb-dataset
Udacity Professional Data Analyst Nanodegree Program - Investigating a dataset using Jupyter Notebook.
## Introduction

### Hello! This is my first project exploring a dataset, thanks to FWD program and Udacity Nanodegree.
### After going through the provided datasets, I found myself attracted to the TMDB dataset due to my passion for watching movies as well as watching a huge number of movies that inspired me throug this project.
## Let's have a small idea about this dataset:
### This dataset was collected by [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) through [TMDB Website](www.themoviedb.org) with more than 10,000 movies as rows(entries) and more than 20 columns of different types of information about these movies
## I have already gone through the dataset and checked other projects for inspiration and made up my mind about how we are going to explore it;
### The dataset provides for each movie: popularity, revenue, budget, list of cast, director, votes, genre, ....etc
### So, I have devided my questions to 4 categories:
### 1: <b>Comparisons</b>: Here we are going to compare the most and least value for some properties and see which movies
### 2: <b>Popularity</b>: Here we are going to see what properties affect popularity of a movie
### 3: <b>Profitability</b>: Here we are going to see what properties affect profitability of a movie
### 4: <b>Frequency</b>: finally we are going to check the frequency of an actor, director, genre,...etc 

## So! are you ready to explore this dataset with me and see what interesting findings we could extract? Let's go!
